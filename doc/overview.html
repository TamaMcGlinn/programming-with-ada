<h1>Goals<a class="headerlink" href="#goals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This series intends to be multiple parts for different audiences:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A Brief Overview Introducing Ada</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="comparison.html">Table comparison of Ada Constructs to C++</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>While my experience with Ada has been positive, this article aims to be as
fact-driven and neutral as possible, attempting to give an objective
overview of the language for those unfamiliar with it, as well as
describing the tradeoffs of using the language.</p>
<p>I am a Windows/Linux developer who primarily works in C++, but
has worked in many other languages in descending level of familiarity: Python,
C, Objective-C, Ruby, Rust, Haskell, Clojure, Perl, some Javascript, and PHP.
I stopped writing Rust consistently right around the time that async/await was
stabilized.  Time permitting I will attempt to write more detailed comparisons
against Rust as well.</p>
<p>I started reading about Ada because a developer I worked with several years
ago had mentioned it, and I couldn’t find a single person who had worked in it.
My intention at the time had been to try it out over the weekend, and after
finding a horribly broken bloated and bureaucratic language, never use it again.
I’ve now been learning and writing Ada 2012 for about a month.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="high-level-language-features">
<h1>High-level Language Features<a class="headerlink" href="#high-level-language-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>&gt; Based on its feature set, I’d describe Ada as a mirror of C++ in the Pascal family,
&gt; with many features of Rust.</p>
<p>Ada supports:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Forced namespacing.</p></li>
<li><p>Sum types (discriminants).</p></li>
<li><p>Parameterized types.</p></li>
<li><p>Static polymorphism (generics).</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic polymorphism (dynamic dispatch, “virtual” functions).</p></li>
<li><p>Compiler and runtime checked constaints on ranges of numerical types.</p></li>
<li><p>Runtime type invariant checking on assignment and usage as parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Semantic types, saying two things are the same backing type, but not the same type of “thing”, think of “Miles” vs “Kilometers” both stored as floats, which cannot be assigned to each other.</p></li>
<li><p>RAII, deterministic construction and destruction of objects (controlled types).</p></li>
<li><p>Design-by-contract (inline preconditions and post-conditions).</p></li>
<li><p>Lifetime checks (“accessibility”, but not as extensive as Rust).</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor types (protected types).</p></li>
<li><p>Task definition with defined synchronization.</p></li>
<li><p>Concurrency types (protected and task).</p></li>
<li><p>Formal verification, by enabling <cite>Spark_Mode</cite> for parts of the program and
writing in SPARK, a language which is an Ada subset.  Think of this along the lines of using <cite>extern “C”</cite>, except for “provable” parts of your code base.</p></li>
<li><p>Exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p>Deterministic and configurable static initialization order.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ada is missing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A preprocessor (GNAT has one, but it’s not standard).</p></li>
<li><p>A sanitary macro system.</p></li>
<li><p>Reflection.</p></li>
<li><p>A concept of “move”.</p></li>
<li><p>Variadic functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Variadic templates.</p></li>
<li><p>Async/Await (it has tasks instead)</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="types-and-ada-the-elephant-in-the-room">
<h1>Types and Ada, The Elephant in the Room<a class="headerlink" href="#types-and-ada-the-elephant-in-the-room" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Ada emphasizes types, but their consistent use despite their complexity
means I can ignore them for now.  Nearly other Ada overview and tutorial
focuses on them, but it doesn’t give an understanding of what Ada looks like
and what it can do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="building-blocks-of-ada">
<h1>Building Blocks of Ada<a class="headerlink" href="#building-blocks-of-ada" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Ada descends from Pascal, and yet uses many concepts already familiar to C or
C++ programmers.  As a long time C++ programmer, I find Ada leverages the concepts
I’m used to in more formal, and often compiler-checked ways.</p>
<div class="section" id="subprograms-functions-and-procedures">
<h2>Subprograms (functions and procedures)<a class="headerlink" href="#subprograms-functions-and-procedures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ada draws a line between functions, which return values, and procedures which
do not return a value.  Collectively referred to as “subprograms”, either of
these may have input (“in”) and output (“out”) parameters, with parameters
being allowed to also be both an input and output (“in out”).  Note that
parameters are separated by semicolons (“;”), not by commas (“,”).</p>
<p>Short functions may be written as expressions bounded by parentheses.  <cite>in</cite> is
also optional for functions, and parameters with the same type can be grouped.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="packages">
<h2>Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As the fundamental building block of Ada, “packages” compose Ada programs,
namespaces which exhibit the logical and physical interfaces in a manner
similar to C++ header and source files.  Most languages don’t have a concept
of “physical interface”–it’s things the compiler needs to know, but
are not part of the logical interface of the program, such as
size details for structs and classes.</p>
<p>Instead of a header files providing an informal spec and an associated source
file being the translation unit, in Ada a package is roughly analogous to a
“header file,” and that package’s body is the “source file”, except assume
everything in each file is in a namespace given by the file name.</p>
<p>Top-level package specifications, appear in <cite>*.ads</cite> (Ada specification) files,
with their implementations (“bodies”) in <cite>*.adb</cite> (Ada body) files, and only
one top-level package specification or package body per file.</p>
<p>Ada packages can also be nested and support visiblity rules for sharing details
with child packages.  Child packages are given by dotted names, such as <cite>A.B</cite>
is a child of package <cite>A</cite>.</p>
<p>Packages can also contain initialization code for the package to run at program
startup prior to entering the main procedure, with the ability to describe
dependencies in package start up order. This solves a specific C++ issue in
which static initialization order is not known, while also offering the ability
to avoid deferred first-time usage costs, such as with singletons.</p>
<p>Ada uses “aspects” to denote additional attributes of packages,  (functions/procedures), and
types.  Along with aspects, compiler pragmas allows description of initialization
dependencies, as well as providing high level checks, such as <cite>pragma Preelaborate</cite>
to ensure a package has no initialization, or the <cite>with Pure</cite> aspect to ensure
that a package has no state and subprograms cannot have side effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-core-tenet-of-ada">
<h2>The Core Tenet of Ada<a class="headerlink" href="#the-core-tenet-of-ada" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Program text must be clear without having to read ahead, referred to as:
<strong>“Linear elaboration of declarations”</strong>.  A clear demarcation exists between
declarations of things to exist and executable statements which use those things.</p>
<p>The simplicity backing this is the ability to make any declaration, including
types, variables, functions/procedures, and packages in any declaration block.  This means
the basic rule of “declare, then use” repeats itself throughout the language,
in <cite>package/package body</cite>, <cite>task/task body</cite>, subprograms
(functions/procedures), and executable blocks of code can have a
<cite>declare … begin … end</cite> block.</p>
<p>This nesting of declarations very verbose.  It does makes it easy to refactor
out behavior while you’re working on a subprogram and then you can extract
the newly created components into more appropriate places when you’re done.
The inability to use statements in declarations causes me to sometimes rewrite
my declarations in sequential order of constant processing, and makes the
declarations feel like a Haskell <cite>where</cite> clause.</p>
<p>Ada does not provide separate syntactical units for classes, structs and
namespaces.  Instead, packages contain types, constants and related subprograms
(functions and procedures).  A lot of specialized syntax goes away due to
this, for example there are no “member functions” and “class functions” and
hence no specialized syntax for things like member function pointers or class
function pointers exist.  Namespacing and overloading on parameters and/or the returned type determine
the subprogram called.</p>
<p>What would be “member functions” in C++ have the “controlling type(s)” as the
first parameter(s).  “<cite>const</cite> member functions” pass in the type as an <cite>in</cite> parameter,
which are immutable.  “non-<cite>const</cite> member functions (methods)” pass in the type as an
<cite>in out</cite> parameter, allowing the parameter to be modified.  This mirrors
Rust’s notation wherein it reflects C++-like <cite>const</cite> behavior of member
functions with <cite>self</cite>, <cite>&amp;self</cite>, and <cite>&amp;mut self</cite> as a first parameter.
These are referred to as “primitive operations.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="raii">
<h1>RAII<a class="headerlink" href="#raii" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Ada supports [RAII](<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization</a>)
by extending the <cite>Controlled</cite> type.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="types">
<h1>Types<a class="headerlink" href="#types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>They’re so powerful I can ignore them for now,
and then you can come back and reread this to understand that types can be
dropped into the system.</p>
<p>Types are important in Ada, so I’m going to do the most bizarre thing and
ignore them for now.  There are incredible number of rules, but the
crucial thing to understand is that most types can just be dropped into
the system interchangably.  Types are important, but the other structures
in which types are used are what makes Ada so powerful and expressive.</p>
<p>Ada turns the tables on types.  They do a lot of things within the language,
but the language isn’t about types.  Types are consistent, there’s not some
weird distinction between objects and “primitives”.</p>
<p>Ada types do a lot more than “put the square peg in the square hole, the round
peg in the round hole” of some other languages.  They define sets of data and
are used like tokens for deciding which functions or procedures to call.</p>
