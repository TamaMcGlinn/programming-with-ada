==============================================================================

This intends to provide a high-level overview of Ada for programmers.  It is
not a tutorial.

I have endeavoured to achieve terseness, clarity and technical accuracy for
those who want a quick overview of the language.  Feel free to submit
corrections or changes to aid in clarity.

Side-by-side comparisons are used, though it may not display properly
on mobile devices.
