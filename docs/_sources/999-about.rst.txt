This intends to provide a high-level overview of Ada for programmers.  It is
not a tutorial.

While my experience with Ada has been positive, this article aims to be as 
fact-driven and neutral as possible, attempting to give an objective
overview of the language for those unfamiliar with it.

I am a Windows/Linux developer who primarily works in C++, but
has worked in many other languages in descending level of familiarity: Python,
C, Objective-C, Ruby, Rust, Haskell, Clojure, Perl, some Javascript, and PHP.

I started reading about Ada because a developer I worked with several years 
ago had mentioned it, and I couldn't find a single person who had worked in it.
I've now been learning and writing Ada 2012 for a couple of months now.

I have endeavoured to achieve terseness, clarity and technical accuracy for
those who want a quick overview of the language.  Feel free to submit
corrections or changes to aid in clarity.

Side-by-side comparisons are used, though it may not display properly
on mobile devices.
